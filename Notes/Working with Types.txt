Core Types 
- number (no special types like floats or integers)
- string ('', "", ``)
- boolean (true, false)
// The key difference is: JavaScript uses 'dynamic types' (resolved at runtime), typescript uses 'static types' (set during development). 
Type Inference (JS does its best to understand the type of a variable on its own unlike typescript).
